# Homelab ***(work in progress)***

This repository documents the evolution of my personal homelab, covering its core infrastructure, virtual machines, containers, network architecture, and more. My goal is to capture what I’ve built, what I’ve learned, and what I continue to refine as my skills and environment grow.

Feel free to explore, take inspiration, or offer constructive feedback—I'm always looking for ways to improve and expand this project.
