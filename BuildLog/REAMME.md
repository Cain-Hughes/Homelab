# B(uild)Log

This directory serves as a monthly record of changes, experiments, improvements, and observations within my homelab environment.

Entries here are intentionally lightweight and focus on real-world engineering work — including network adjustments, infrastructure changes, performance tuning, troubleshooting, and design decisions.

The purpose of this log is to document the evolution of the environment over time rather than provide formal documentation.
